goal:
Help students who want to continue their studies outside of their countries

Motivation:
As a foreign student, I had to face this kind of situation where you do not have the information needed to begin a process of immigration in order to continue studies outside of your country.Faced with this lack of information, some took the opportunity to defraud poor students seeking only to expand their knowledge. These students may pay sums of up to $ 2,500.

Solution:
This application is therefore intended to assist students step by step until the visa by providing them with the information they need.

Target: 
foreign student of Africa, for starters. And for an extension in the future in Asie, Europe and America.
